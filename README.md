Project Name: Gator-Dex
Project Description: Gator-Dex will be a tool for students to construct and share their flash card sets for classes and exams amongst one another. 
The site will allow students with a UF student email to create an account, construct flash card decks, and share them. 
The decks will be sorted by classcode and by unit/exam within that class.
